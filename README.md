# Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga - Multiplayer Script for BizHawk

In Development (Currently only works properly in the Overworld and in Menus)

This Script allows you to control Superstar Saga with two people,
each taking control of one Brother. The Brother at the front is responsible for Movement (eg. the Dpad) and can pause the game.

### To be implemented:

- Battle Detection
    - Active Battle
    - Current Turn
    - Level Up Sequence
- Minigame Detection


## Features

- Configurable Multi Controller Support
- Both Players only control their Brother, other Buttons are disabled
- A single Button is used for Actions, regardless of whether you are at the front or the rear
- Configurable Permissions for the Swap Action (Take / Give Control)
